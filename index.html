        <h2>stone age period</h2>
<p class="error">Countries are grouped partially by their performance in each indicator into three groups of approximately
    equal size (terciles), thus, there is the top third, the middle third and the bottom third. The intention is not
    to suggest the thresholds or target values for these indicators but to allow a crude assessment of
    country’s performance relative to others. Three-colour coding visualizes a partial grouping of countries by
    indicator. It can be seen as a simple visualization tool as it helps the users to immediately picture the
    country’s performance. A country that is in the top group performs better than at least two thirds of
    countries (i.e., it is among the top third performers); a country that is in the middle group performs better
    than at least one third but worse than at least one third (i.e., it is among the medium third performers);
    and a country that is in the bottom third performs worse than at least two thirds of countries (i.e., it is
    among the bottom third performers). Three-color coding visualizes a partial grouping of countries by
    indicator. More details about partial grouping in this table are given in Technical note 6.
    Dashboard 1: Quality of human development</p>
    <h2>Dawn of a new day</h2>
    <p>This dashboard contains a selection of 13 indicators associated with the quality of health, education and
    standard of living. The indicators on quality of health are lost health expectancy, number of physicians,
    and number of hospital beds. The indicators on quality of education are pupil-teacher ratio in primary
    schools; primary school teachers trained to teach; proportion of schools with access to the internet; and
    the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) scores in mathematics, reading and science.
    The indicators on quality of standard of living are the proportion of employed people engaged in
    vulnerable employment, the proportion of rural population with access to electricity, the proportion of
    population using improved drinking water sources and proportion of population using improved sanitation
    facilities.</p>
    <p class="joy">A country that is in the top third group on all indicators can be considered a country with the highest
    quality of human development. The dashboard shows that not all countries in the very high human
    development group have the highest quality of human development and that many countries in the low
    human development group are in the bottom third of all quality indicators in the table.
    Table F provides the number of indicators in which Bahrain performs: better than at least two thirds of
    countries (i.e., it is among the top third performers); better than at least one third but worse than at least
    one third (i.e., it is among the medium third performers); and worse than at least two thirds of countries
    (i.e., it is among the bottom third performers). Figures for Qatar and United Arab Emirates are also shown
    in the table for comparison.</p>
